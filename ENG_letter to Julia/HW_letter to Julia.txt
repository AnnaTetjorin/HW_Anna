Dear Julia,

I'm writting to ask you about the topic for the next class. I would like to prepair for our next lesson at home. I would like to read some material and be ready to discuss the topic.
So I would appreciate it if you would write me the theme for the next class.

My homework from the previous lesson is done. There were very interesting exercises. Thanks a lot for your hard work and all your lessons. They are so helpful. You can find the "Homework" file attached to this email.

Thank you very much in advance!

Best regards,
Anna
