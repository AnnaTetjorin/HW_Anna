Tell me about yourself

My name is Anna. I would like to describe myself as a positive, energetic, knowlegeable and industrious person. Moreover I would like to say that I am a high-achieving worker and a good team-worker. My first education is pedagogical, it means that I am a teacher. My strength is dependance, I consistently meet deadlines, so i'm responsible. Communication is my strength too. When you work with different personalities, you need be able to talk with them. I'm ready to talk with my colleges or clients. I'm self-motivated, I stay focused on my task. One more strength that I have is confidence.  I pay attention to every little thing I need to do to reach my goals.
What I look for? I have interest in working at your company. I know what your company does. That's why I would like to have an opportunity to show my knowledges and to be a part of your team.
